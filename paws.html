        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <h2> <u>History About Dogs</u></h2>
    <div class="less">

    <h3>
        Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf 
        lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern 
        living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago.
         The timing and location of dog domestication is a matter of debate. 
         There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events 
         occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. 
         In this region wolves likely facilitated their own domestication by trailing nomadic 
         people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left behind.
         Most studies agree that domestication was not a single discrete event.
        It was a process that unfolded over thousands of yearsâ€”likely involving dog populations 
        that appeared in different parts of Eurasia at different times, with dogs and wild wolves continuing 
        to interbreed with one another and with early dog populations being replaced by later ones.
        Some genetic studies have documented evidence of early domestication events in specific regions. 
        One study contends that wolves were domesticated 16,300 years ago to serve as livestock in China, 
        whereas another reports that early dogs dating from about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago came from a 
        small strain of gray wolf that inhabited India. Genetic evidence also reveals that dogs did not accompany 
        the first humans to the New World more than 15,000 years ago, suggesting instead that dogs came to 
        the Americas only some 10,000 years ago. One study even suggested that some dogs have descended not 
        from the wolf but rather from the jackal. These dogs, found in Africa, might have given 
        rise to some of the present native African breeds.
        Dogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first domesticated animals. 
        They were important in hunter-gatherer societies as hunting allies and bodyguards against predators. 
        When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs served as herders and 
        guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle. Although many still serve in these capacities, 
        dogs are mainly used for social purposes and companionship. Today dogs are employed as guides for
         the blind and disabled or for police work. Dogs are even used in therapy in nursing homes and 
         hospitals to encourage patients toward recovery. Humans have bred a wide range of different 
         dogs adapted to serve a variety of functions. This has been enhanced by improvements in 
         veterinary care and animal husbandry.
        In ancient Egypt dogs were thought to possess godlike characteristics. They were pampered by their own servants, 
        outfitted with jeweled collars, and fed the choicest diet. Only royalty was permitted to own 
        purebred dogs, and upon the death of a ruler his favourite dog was often 
        interred with him to protect him from harm in the afterlife.
        Illustrations of dogs dating from the Bronze Age have been found on walls, 
        tombs, and scrolls throughout Europe, the Middle East, and North America. 
        Often the dogs are depicted hunting game with their human counterparts. 
        Statues of dogs guard the entrances to burial crypts. 
        In many cases these dogs clearly resemble modern canines. 
        Such relics are indelible testimony to the importance that
        humans have given to the dog throughout the ages.

        <h1> Their Aggression And Health Issues</h1>
        <h2>Health Issues And Safety</h2>
        <p> <b>
            Dogs can suffer from a variety of health problems ranging from intestinal parasites, 
            skin disease and ear infections, eye problems, digestive upset and dental disease. 
            Many of these conditions can cause uncomfortable symptoms for our canine companions. 
            Any pet with severe or persistent symptoms should receive a full veterinary evaluation and workup. 
            Pets with milder or acute symptom flare-ups can be often helped with over the counter medications and topical therapies.
            Tapeworms
            Tapeworms are common in dogs and are usually transmitted by ingesting fleas at some point. 
            Other dogs may become infected by ingesting feces of other animals. Tapeworms may cause abdominal bloating,
            as well as mild digestive upset and anal irritation and itching. Many animal guardians will find flat rice-like 
            segments crawling out of the anus near the tail or even directly in the feces of infected animals. 
            Virbantel is an excellent product that contains two strong worming medications affective against roundworms, 
            hookworms, and tapeworms. HomeoPet Wrm Clear is a natural alternative that is also sometimes effective. 
            In severe cases, prescription medications like Droncit, Cestex or Drontal Plus may be prescribed by some 
            veterinarians. Because of the role fleas play in the life cycle of tapeworms, it is important to 
            implement good flea control with topical products like Advantage II or Frontline Plus in both 
            managing and preventing tapeworm infection. Because humans can become infected it is important to 
            implement treatment and prevention strategies against tapeworms.
            Intestinal worms
            Worms are a chronic problem in dogs and are also a concern for families. Many pets' intestinal 
            worms can infect humans, and children are particularly at risk. Intestinal worms are especially 
            a problem in young puppies. Left untreated, worm overgrowth may lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, 
            diarrhea, anemia and even death in severe cases. Virbantel is a broad spectrum wormer that can control 
            roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms. Use Panacur C to control roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and some tapeworms.  
            Many animal guardians will use over-the-counter Ivomec to worm many dogs, however, careful attention to dosing 
            must be followed to avoid overdose and toxicity. HomeoPet Wrm Clear is a natural alternative for some animal 
            guardians, as is diatomaceous earth. Iverhart Max is a relatively new oral prescription wormer that is often
            quite effective in treating and preventing intestinal worms, as well as heartworms in many pets.</b>

            <h2> Aggression</h2>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Though aggression can be a normal canine behavior, aggression is a complex, 
                    serious and dangerous behavior problem for dog owners. Expression of aggression may range
                    from inhibited communication such as a warning growl, snarl or a snap and include, 
                    f course, severe uninhibited repetitive bites that may be quite injurious. 
                    The decision to keep or rehome a dog that has demonstrated aggressive responses is 
                    complicated and serious and may have legal consequences. Since there are many different 
                    types of aggression, making a diagnosis, determining the prognosis (the chances of 
                    safe and effective correction), and developing an appropriate treatment plan are usually 
                    best handled with the help of a veterinary or applied animal behaviorist.

                    To treat the problem effectively, it will first be necessary to determine which type 
                    of aggression your dog displays: conflict-related, fear, possessive, protective, territorial,
                    maternal, play, redirected, pain-induced, interdog aggression, aggression toward familiar and 
                    unfamiliar people, status-related aggression, pathophysiological (or medical), or learned. 
                    In many cases, more than one form of aggression may be exhibited (see Aggression). 
                    Treatment is addressed separately.
